# CP1404 Practical Reflection

### Min Thiha Khine (14686570)

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've started taking time estimation more seriously by actually recording my estimated vs actual time in module
docstrings. This has helped me become more realistic about how long programming tasks take. I've also begun writing code
on paper first for complex logic, which helps me think through the structure before jumping into PyCharm. Additionally,
I'm now using test data more effectively instead of manually typing inputs repeatedly during testing.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to spend more time planning my code structure before writing. Sometimes I rush into coding without thinking about
functions and class design, leading to messier code that I have to refactor. I also need to be more consistent with git
commits - sometimes I forget to commit regularly with meaningful messages. Finally, I should ask for help sooner when
stuck rather than spending too long trying to figure things out alone.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm good at understanding and applying object-oriented concepts like encapsulation and method design. I consistently
write meaningful docstrings and comments, which helps with code readability. I'm also developing good habits around
input validation and error handling. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through the practicals without fully understanding each concept. Sometimes I focus too much on
getting the code to work rather than understanding why it works. I should also stop neglecting the testing phase - I
tend to assume my code works without thoroughly testing edge cases. Additionally, I need to better organize my project
files and folder structure from the beginning.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would appreciate more examples of real-world applications for the programming concepts we're learning. While the
practical exercises are good for understanding syntax and structure, seeing how these OOP principles apply in actual
software development projects would help motivate learning and show the bigger picture. Perhaps including a small group
project or connecting the concepts to industry examples would be valuable.
