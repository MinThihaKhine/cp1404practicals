# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was inconsistent at first. Sometimes I underestimated how long a task would take, especially when
it involved new concepts or debugging. Other times, I overestimated simpler tasks.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

better at identifying which parts would likely take longer, such as debugging or researching unfamiliar modules.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to approach tasks more strategically. Estimating time forced me to think ahead, consider possible challenges,
and manage my time more efficiently. It also helped me recognize patterns in how I work and how long I typically take
for certain types of tasks.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to see my code from another perspective. Reviewers often pointed out areas where I could simplify my code, use better naming conventions, or make it more Pythonic. It made me more open to feedback and taught me to improve my code quality without taking criticism personally.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?


Doing code reviews helped me practice critical thinking and reinforced my own understanding of good coding practices. I learned to spot both logic errors and style issues, and reviewing others' code often gave me ideas for improving my own.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.
