## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was inconsistent at first. Sometimes I underestimated how long a task would take, especially when
it involved new concepts or debugging. Other times, I overestimated simpler tasks.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

better at identifying which parts would likely take longer, such as debugging or researching unfamiliar modules.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to approach tasks more strategically. Estimating time forced me to think ahead, consider possible challenges,
and manage my time more efficiently. It also helped me recognize patterns in how I work and how long I typically take
for certain types of tasks.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to see my code from another perspective. Reviewers often pointed out areas where I could simplify my code, use
better naming conventions, or make it more Pythonic. It made me more open to feedback and taught me to improve my code
quality without taking criticism personally.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Doing code reviews helped me practice critical thinking and reinforced my own understanding of good coding practices. I
learned to spot both logic errors and style issues, and reviewing others' code often gave me ideas for improving my own.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 5 PR](https://github.com/lzhpeng/CP1404-practicals/pull/1#issuecomment-3040969367)

### Explanation

This review combined both code-level and professional practice feedback. I highlighted good aspects of the
implementation, such as clear structure and readable formatting. At the same time, I encouraged improvements like
avoiding magic numbers by dynamically calculating values (e.g. string width for alignment), and using clearer variable
names. Beyond the code, I provided guidance on writing better commit messages by explaining how to use imperative mood
and be more concise. I also gave examples to make the suggestions practical and easy to apply. This review shows an
understanding of both clean coding principles and real-world development habits.

### Good Code Review 2

[Practical 6 PR](https://github.com/luchuanjun/cp1404practicals/pull/2#issuecomment-3066718928)

### Explanation

I praised the code for being readable and functional, then suggested a more maintainable approach for formatting output.
Instead of hardcoding spacing (e.g., :>20), I recommended calculating the maximum length dynamically, which makes the
program more adaptable to different data inputs. This shows attention to both usability and scalability.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would include more real-world context in the tasks, perhaps small projects that simulate actual software problems. Iâ€™d
also encourage pair programming for a few practicals to foster collaboration and shared learning.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I stayed consistent with completing all tasks on time and kept my code organized and readable. I also put effort into
testing my code thoroughly and learning from my mistakes through feedback and self-reflection.
