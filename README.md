# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

# Repository Summary

This repository contains my practical work and exercises for the CP1404 Programming II subject at James Cook University. Each directory represents different practical sessions where I've implemented various programming concepts, design patterns, and clean code practices.

## About Me

I'm a student currently studying Bachelor of IT at James Cook University. Through this subject, I'm developing my skills in object-oriented programming, software design patterns, and professional programming practices using Python.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by practical sessions, with each directory containing the exercises and projects completed during that week's practical work.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned

Throughout this subject, I have learned several important principles about writing clean, maintainable code:

- **Meaningful Names**: Using descriptive variable and function names that clearly communicate their purpose makes code much easier to read and understand. Avoiding abbreviations and cryptic names helps other developers (and future me) quickly grasp what the code does.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function and class should have one clear purpose and do it well. This makes code more modular, easier to test, and simpler to modify when requirements change.

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoiding code duplication by creating reusable functions and classes reduces maintenance overhead and the risk of inconsistent behavior when changes are needed.

- **Consistent Formatting and Style**: Following PEP 8 guidelines and maintaining consistent indentation, spacing, and naming conventions makes code more professional and easier to read across the entire project.

- **Proper Error Handling**: Implementing appropriate exception handling and input validation makes programs more robust and provides better user experience when things go wrong.
