# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched 100% of the lecture videos but I have to watch the git part multiple times to fully grasp it.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I typically watch lecture videos on weekday evenings between 7-9 PM in my study room, sometimes if I m lazy on the bed.
I allocate 1-2 hours per session depending on the content complexity, with additional time for rewatching challenging
concepts like Git workflows.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I 'm staying consistent with watching all lecture videos and taking detailed notes during each session. I'm also
practicing coding examples, like the do this now immediately after Mr Lindsay tells me to do it while I am watching
videos, which helps reinforce the concepts. My habit of revisiting difficult topics like Git multiple times until I
understand them is proving effective for long-term retention.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating on starting practical assignments until the weekends. I think this is because I think
that I have time and would get the work perfectly done if I work during my peak condition. I should also improve my time
management by breaking down larger programming tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Additionally, I need to start
participating more actively in online forums and asking questions when I'm stuck rather than spending too much time
trying to figure everything out independently. (I actually got stuck on git for 2 hours, watched the videos 2-3 times,
explored youtube for git because of a branch push issue)

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I'm doing work on weekends and procrastinating too much. I strive for perfection and work on weekends thinking I will do
better, but I think I can get it done faster and get the workload out of my mind if I do the work the same day I had the
lecture class. This would help me avoid the stress of leaving everything until the weekend and allow me to tackle
problems while the concepts are still fresh in my memory.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently complete the basic requirements and often attempt extension challenges. My code structure is generally
well-organized, and I'm good at breaking down complex problems into smaller functions. I also document my code clearly
with meaningful comments explaining my thought process.
